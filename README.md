# Weather Forecast App

## Description
This simple web app takes in user input of a city and gives back a 5 day forecast! You get to see humidity, wind, temperature, date, and an icon for conditions! It'll also save your past searches in case you want to check back in.

## Motivation
I wanted to have a better understanding of how to use server side APIs and in a practical way. There are lots of apps that integrate weather in some way, so it's an extra plus to learning API integration in general.
